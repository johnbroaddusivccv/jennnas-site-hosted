            <strong>&#9733;FREDDIE/BRIAN/JOHN/ROGER&#9733;</strong>
            <br />
            Queen was a British rock band that was founded in 1970. The band members were Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon. Freddie was the lead singer, Brian was on guitar, Roger was the drummer, and John was the bassist. They produced 14 albums, 53 top 40 singles, and 6 number one hits.

        <h2>Why is Queen so loved by me? Let me explain.</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>They are iconic! Their riffs and instrumentals are like a built in memory for many people. They also paved the way for more bands to create diversity within their musical style. Queen was rejected by producers for their song "Bohemian Rhapsody," because they felt it pushed the boundaries a little too far. They felt that the integration of classical music with the world of rock was going to fall flat among audiences. Instead of giving up on what they saw as a masterpiece, the band produced the song anyway and it is globally renowned to this day. I would go so far as to say that there's almost no adult out there that doesn't know at least a couple of Queen's songs. Lead singer, Freddie Mercury, wore a look at his final show (the 1985 Live Aid concert) that is commonly replicated amongst costume wearers and fans. This look is a basic white wifebeater with heavily faded denim jeans, a black studded belt, a black studded arm band around the right bicep, and the unforgettable chevron mustache (pictured below).</li>
            <li>They remind me of fond memories with my dad while I was growing up. I fondly recall that whenever a classic rock song played, my dad would ask me and my brother, "Which band is this?!," to quiz us and we would yell out our answers... not always correctly, but we learned in time. I remember rocking out in the garage with my dad while he was working on projects. Many of those times, there were several Queen songs in the lineup and even as a child, they were always my ultimate favorite.</li>
            <li>They broadened the minds of many with Freddie being a man of Indian and Persian descent <em>and</em> a sexually fluid man. The time of Queen was a time where the concept of immigrants of his background was not one that was too welcome. Yet there was a bit of mystery around Freddie, making him a source of interest for many. His sexuality was fluid but undefined. He had a string of male lovers, however in his earlier life he was devoted to a woman whom he kept his love for until his tragic passing. He also brought awareness to HIV/AIDS as this is what eventually caused his life to end. At a time where this awful disease was regarded as something to be utterly ashamed of, his battle with it instilled within countless fans and non-fans alike the motivation to understand it more. Despite everything working against Freddie, he, the band, and their music became beloved fixtures within the world of Rock, even expanding to people who didn't take an interest in Rock music.</li>
            <li>They get the people goin'. If you were to place a speaker in the middle of a crowd and start playing Queen songs, I'd be willing to bet that you'd see some form of comradery starting to take place. You would be able to look around see at least a few people mouthing the words and maybe even some people dancing!</li>
            <li>Their music just makes me happy. :)</li>
